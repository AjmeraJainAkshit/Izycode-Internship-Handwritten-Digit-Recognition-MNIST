# Izycode Internship: Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)

## Introduction
Welcome to the Handwritten Digit Recognition project! This project aims to build a robust model that can recognize handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. It serves as a foundational task in image classification and sets the stage for more advanced image recognition applications.

## Problem Statement
The challenge is to develop an algorithm that accurately classifies images of handwritten digits. This involves understanding the nuances of human handwriting and translating them into a form that a machine can interpret and learn from.

## Project Overview
Throughout the model building process, we will delve into various data science concepts including:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Outlier detection and removal
- Feature engineering


## Technologies and Tools
This project leverages the following technologies and tools:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the project.
- **Numpy and Pandas**: For efficient data preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib**: To visualize data and insights.
- **Keras & Tensorflow**: For building and training the neural network models.
- **Scikit-learn (Sklearn)**: For additional model building and evaluation.
- **Jupyter Notebook & Visual Studio Code**: As Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for writing and testing code.
